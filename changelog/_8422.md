### Changed

- Updated module page forms to feature a grey background container and buttons, aligning with the BO style guide (e.g., the proposal form now uses the "form--base panel--heavy" classes for consistency).
- Relocated follow.scss to a4-follow.scss within the adhocracy folder, indicating that it overwrites styles for an A4 component.

### Added
- Introduced a reusable snippet `form_submit_actions.html` to enhance consistency and maintainability across forms.
