### Added

- custom migration to make iframes work with ckeditor5
- added dependency beautifulsoup4

### Changed

- replace django-ckeditor with django-ckeditor5
- disable browser-side form checks for forms which use ckeditor by adding
  `novalidate` to them  This is necessary as ckeditor form fields which are
  required will block form submission otherwise.
