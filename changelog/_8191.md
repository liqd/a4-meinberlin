### Added

- **New Block**: Introduced `AccordionListBlock`, a new block type for rendering a list of accordion items. This block allows multiple `AccordionBlock` instances to be grouped and displayed as a list of accordions. Includes an optional `list_title` field for the list header.
- Added `_accordion-list.scss` to the `/components_user_facing` folder to style the new accordion list component.

### Changed

- **Breaking Change**: Renamed `DocsBlock` into `AccordionBlock` on `cms/blocks.py` for consistency.
- Modified `AccordionBlock` to support dynamic heading levels based on context. It now adjusts between `h2` and `h3` depending on whether it is used as a standalone block or within a list.
- Updated the `accordion_list_block.html` and `accordion_block.html` templates to accommodate the new `AccordionListBlock` structure and dynamic heading levels.
- `_accordion.scss` has been renamed to `collapsible-fragment` to reflect the respective template and located to a new `/ck-editor` subfolder in `components_user_facing`.
- The `details.scss` file now handles styling for the `<details>` barebones element, adopting a more semantic HTML approach.

### Removed

- **Breaking Change**: The previous standalone implementation of `AccordionBlock` is now deprecated in favor of the new `AccordionListBlock` structure for lists of accordions. Existing templates using the old `DocsBlock` standalone format need to be updated.
- Removed old CSS styles associated with the previous accordion implementation. Styles related to `_accordion.scss` and outdated approaches have been deprecated.
