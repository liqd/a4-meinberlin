# Added

- show point field for bplans in the django-admin

### Changed

- adapt bplan api to the requirements for the diplan system
  - add a new field `is_diplan` to the bplan model to be able to differentiate
    between old bplans from imperia and new ones from diplan
  - add the `point` field to the serializer as we no longer need to get it from
    the bplan map for bplans coming from diplan
  - calculate the district from the bplan identifier instead of getting it from
    the bplan map
  - keep compatibility with the imperia system for now but annotated code which
    can be removed once the transition to diplan is completed
  - update the bplan api documentation
  - add a `bplan_id` field which will replace the `identifier` field once the
  switch to diplan is done
