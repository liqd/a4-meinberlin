### Changed

- Fixed incorrect use of `rem` values in old variables to ensure proper functionality in `em`-based layouts.

### Removed
- Removed outdated breakpoint variables (`$breakpoint-xs`, `$breakpoint`, `$breakpoint-md`, `$breakpoint-lg`, etc.) as these `min-width` and `max-width` queries no longer align with the redesign requirements.
