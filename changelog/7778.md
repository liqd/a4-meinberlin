### Added

- settings: move A4_PROJECT_TOPICS to Enum class
- apps/plans: topics as an m2m relation to plans, replacing django-multiselectfield
- apps/projects: topics from TopicEnum, topic form and serializer for projects
- **Breaking Change** Plan topics with a code longer than 3 chars will be dropped.
  If you need to keep them modify the check in
  `meinberlin/apps/plans/migratiosn/0059_migrate_topics_to_m2m_topics.py` or
  migrate them to shorter codes. Note: the max. possible length is still limited to 10.
