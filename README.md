# Participation platform mein.berlin

mein.berlin is a participation platform for the city of Berlin, Germany. It is
based on [adhocracy 4](https://github.com/liqd/adhocracy4).

![Build Status](https://github.com/liqd/a4-meinberlin/actions/workflows/django.yml/badge.svg)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/liqd/a4-meinberlin/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/liqd/a4-meinberlin?branch=main)

## Requirements

- nodejs (+ npm)
- python 3.x (+ venv + pip)
- libmagic
- libjpeg
- libpq (only if postgres should be used)
- gdal
- sqlite3 [with JSON1 enabled](https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/JSON1Extension)(only if sqlite is used for local development)
- redis (in production, not needed for development)

## Installation (for development and testing only!)

    git clone https://github.com/liqd/a4-meinberlin.git
    cd a4-meinberlin
    make install
    make fixtures
    make watch

### Use postgresql database for testing:

run the following command once:

```
make postgres-create
```

to start the testserver with postgresql, run:

```
export DATABASE=postgresql
make postgres-start
make watch
```

### Use Celery for task queues

For a celery worker to pick up tasks you need to make sure that:

- the redis server is running
- the celery config parameter "always eager" is disabled (add `CELERY_TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER = False` to your `local.py`)

To start a celery worker node in the foreground, call:

```
make celery-worker-start
```

To inspect all registered tasks, list the running worker nodes, call:

```
make celery-worker-status
```

To send a dummy task to the queue and report the result, call:

```
make celery-worker-dummy-task
```

### Style Library

*   currently all js and css incl fontawesome files are downloaded due to difficulties serving files and slowing development
    *   img and font resouce paths within the berlin css have been updated to include the local version
*   Until versioning of libraries implemented prefered solution would be to have js downloaded once per day and cached, css should only be updated before release due to issues of breaking changes not being versioned or announced.
