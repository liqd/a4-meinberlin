### Changed
- Renamed blueprint-picker.js to blueprint-dialog.js, completely removing Bootstrap and jQuery dependencies in favor of vanilla JavaScript with the native HTML dialog element
- Fixed issue with body element being modified by Bootstrap modal code
- Added proper AJAX request handling with `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` header to ensure only dialog content is loaded
- Refactored modal in `nav_modules.html` to use native HTML `<dialog>` element for better performance and accessibility

### Added
- `/components_dashboard/_blueprint-dialog.scss` for styling the native dialog component
